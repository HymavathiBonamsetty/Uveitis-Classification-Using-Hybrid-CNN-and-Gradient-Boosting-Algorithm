# Uveitis-Classification-Using-Hybrid-CNN-and-Gradient-Boosting-Algorithm

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a robust and efficient framework for the classification of uveitis, a complex and potentially sight-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The proposed framework leverages a hybrid approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gradient Boosting to achieve accurate classification results.

## Motivation
Early diagnosis and classification of uveitis are crucial for initiating timely and targeted treatment strategies, thus preventing potential vision loss. However, uveitis classification poses significant challenges due to the diverse manifestations and subtle differences in clinical presentations. Traditional methods often struggle with accuracy and generalization when dealing with such complexities.

## Approach
Our framework utilizes a hybrid approach that capitalizes on the strengths of CNNs and Gradient Boosting models. CNNs are employed to extract discriminative features from fundus images, which capture the intricate details necessary for accurate classification. These features are then fed into a Gradient Boosting model for final classification. This combination allows for improved accuracy, interpretability, and scalability in uveitis classification.

## Features
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines CNNs and Gradient Boosting for enhanced performance.
- **Feature Extraction:** CNNs extract discriminative features from fundus images.
- **Interpretability:** Gradient Boosting model provides insights into the decision-making process.
- **Scalability:** Framework can be adapted for use with large datasets and diverse clinical settings.

## Usage
To utilize the framework, follow these steps:
1. **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess fundus images of patients with uveitis.
2. **Model Training:** Train the CNNs to extract features from the images.
3. **Classification:** Feed the extracted features into the Gradient Boosting model for classification.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the framework using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
